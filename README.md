This video game is based on the famous Greek/Roman Myth of Sisyphus. He angered the gods by tricking them and trying to escape death. As punishment, he was sentenced to push a boulder up a mountain in hell. But every time he got close to the top, the enchanted boulder would roll back down. He was forced to repeat this task forever, to eternity.

On top of the "looping" curse, another element that fits the theme is the giant boulder that keeps on spinning :)
